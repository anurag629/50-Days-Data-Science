Such as if an organization wants to protect an object/information from unwanted access by clients or any unauthorized person then encapsulation is the way to ensure this.\n",

    "Now for actually preventing the access of attributes/methods from outside the scope of a class, you can use “private members“. In order to declare the attributes/method as private members, use double underscore ( __ ) in the prefix. Such as – self.__name or def __method(); Both of these lines tell that the attribute and method are private and access is not possible from outside the class.\n",
